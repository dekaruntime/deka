//! Production React builtins for `@js/react*` (rfd#64 amendment 2).
//!
//! The resolver serves these specifiers in run/serve/bundle with no install
//! and no `deka.json` entry. Development React stays feature-gated under
//! `crates/http/vendor/react/`.
//!
//! Seams live in sibling modules:
//!
//! - [`vendor`]: pinned production CJS sources, hashes, and export lists.
//! - [`specs`]: user-facing specifiers, URL mapping, and reachable files.
//! - [`rewrite`]: dsc stub rewrite and host-owned CJS inlining.
//! - [`esm`]: ESM wrappers around the vendored CJS factories.
//! - [`islands`]: `client:*` host wrap and live-signal SSR prerender.
