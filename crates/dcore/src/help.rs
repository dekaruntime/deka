//! Help content for the `deka` CLI.
//!
//! Rendering here is pure text formatting over `Registry` data — no I/O.
//! `cli::mod` is the only place that prints; keeping the formatting in
//! `dcore` keeps `crates/cli/src` inside its composition-only line budget
//! (see `scripts/check-cli-surface.sh`).
//!
//! Two kinds of content live here:
//! - a hand-written [`CommandHelp`] for the commands a brand-new user
//!   touches first (deka#977) — real usage lines and copy-pasteable
//!   examples, not generated from the registry.
//! - a generic fallback for every other registered command, built from
//!   whatever the registry actually has (summary, subcommands, and its
//!   own flags/params — see [`CommandFlags`]) so help never claims a
//!   flag, param, or subcommand that isn't really there.
//!
//! Flag/param ownership (deka#996 review): `Registry::add_flag`/
//! `add_param` just push onto one shared flat list with no owner tag, so a
//! name lookup against that list resolves to whichever command happened to
//! register that name *first* — wrong whenever two commands share a name
//! (`--version`, `--token`, `--yes`, `--registry`, `--json`, `--list`, ...).
//! [`build_ownership_index`] avoids this without touching the external
//! registry crate: registration is a pure sequence of `add_command`/
//! `add_flag`/`add_param` calls, so re-running each registration function
//! against a private scratch [`Registry`] reveals exactly what *that*
//! function adds, uncontaminated by every other command sharing the real
//! registry. [`render_command_help`] renders only from that per-command
//! result, never from a global name search.
//!
//! deka#1007: the same contamination risk applies to *command/subcommand*
//! name resolution, not just flags — a bare `install` can refer to a
//! top-level command or to `pkg install`'s subcommand, and something has
//! to decide which qualified form(s) to show in a did-you-mean suggestion.
//! [`build_ownership_index`] derives that too, from the exact same re-run,
//! into [`OwnershipIndex::qualified_names`]. [`expand_suggestions`] reads
//! it directly instead of re-walking the registry a second time, so there
//! is one technique, one function, and one result describing who owns a
//! name — never two mechanisms that can drift apart the way #996 found.
